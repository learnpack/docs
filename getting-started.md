# Getting Started with LearnPack (Quick Start)

There are two use cases that you can take advantage of when using LearnPack. 

The first one is as a [creator](#Creators) of interactive tutorials, and the second use case is as a [learner](#Learners), where you will be consuming interactive tutorials created by the creators.
Find LearnPack at npm, click  to download the package: [click here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@learnpack/learnpack). 

> âœ‹ Make sure you have node installed before going to the next step!)

## Creators

### Start your first tutorial

To create your first tutorial, you have to follow these steps:

1. Install LearnPack globally on your computer by running this command (You should have node installed): `$ npm install @learnpack/learnpack -g`.  
2. Go to the path where you want to save the tutorialâ€™s repository, and create the directory where you want them to be: `$ mkdir name-of-tutorials`.  
3. Then run this command to start configuring your tutorial: `$ learnpack init`.  
This command will ask you everything about your tutorialâ€™s configuration, answer all the questions and your tutorialâ€™s project will be successfully created. These are the questions it will ask you:

First, it will ask you the grading type ([Grading Tutorials](./grading-tutorials)) you want for your tutorial:

A) **Incremental**: In this type of exercise you canâ€™t go to the next exercise until you pass the test of the current one. It is incremental, so further exercises require the knowledge of previous exercises.  

B) **Isolated**: Each exercise is independent so you can go to any exercise in the order you prefer. The latest exercises donâ€™t need earlier exercisesâ€™ knowledge.  

C) **No Grading**: These exercises arenâ€™t graded, therefore they donâ€™t have tests.

â€‹â€‹
4. Next, it will ask for the tutorialâ€™s title.

â€‹â€‹
5. It should ask for the description after the title.

6. Then it will ask you for the difficulty of your tutorial exercises (Beginner, Easy, Intermediate, Hard).
â€‹â€‹
7. The next question will be how many hours it should take to complete the tutorial.
â€‹â€‹
It will create all the files of your tutorial.  
This is what your project should look like:

â€‹â€‹
Now you have to add the folder of each of the exercises that you are going to add to your tutorial with a structure similar to the one created by the command `$ learnpack init`. 

It should have the `README.md` file, the `test` file, and the entry file (usually called `app.<ext>` where the extension (`ext`) depends on the learning language. For example, if we are building a Python tutorial, it will be `app.py` (this name can be overridden on the configuration options.

The last two files depend on the language you are using.

## Learners

1. To install the LearnPack CLI, run the npm install @learnpack/learnpack -g.

2. Install the tutorial you want to use by downloading the repository code, for example: You can use the `git clone` command to download [these exercises](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial
```

3. Install the LearnPack plugin that you need depending on the programming language that the tutorial uses, for example, for installing the javascript plugin you can run `learnpack plugins:install learnpack-node`.

After installing everything, the last step to start using LearnPack, is running the command learnpack start
