# How to Successfully Create Quizzes for LearnPack üìù

Quizzes are an engaging and effective way to test a user‚Äôs knowledge and comprehension of a topic. They help users think critically and make lessons more interactive. In LearnPack, quizzes are created using **plain markdown** and are rendered into interactive content using specific formatting rules.

In this guide, we‚Äôll explain how to properly structure and format your quizzes to ensure they work seamlessly in LearnPack.

## üîë Key Rules for Creating Quizzes

### 1. Structure of a Quiz

- **Each question** must have a title, which serves as the question text itself.
- The question title must be **separated by an empty line** from the answer options.
- **Answer options** must be written as a checklist using Markdown‚Äôs checkbox syntax (`- [ ]` for incorrect answers, and `- [x]` for the correct answer).

### 2. One Correct Answer

- Each question must have **only one correct answer** to avoid ambiguity and ensure the quiz functions correctly.

### 3. Proper Indentation for Options

- Options must be indented by **3 to 6 spaces** under the question title. (If you‚Äôre using an editor like VSCode, pressing `Tab` to indent usually works.)
- Incorrect indentation will cause the quiz to fail when parsed into HTML.

### 4. Empty Line Between Title and Options

- Always **leave a blank line** between the question title and the start of the answer options. This is critical for LearnPack to correctly identify the quiz structure.

## üí° Pro Tips for Quiz Creation

1. **Use a Markdown Editor**: Editors like **VSCode** or **Obsidian** make it easy to write and format markdown files. Use tools like `Shift + Alt + F` in VSCode to auto-format your file, ensuring proper indentation.
2. **Test Your Quiz**: Before publishing, preview your markdown file to ensure the structure works and that the correct answer is clearly marked.
3. **Engage Your Audience**: Write questions that are clear, concise, and relevant to the lesson. Avoid overly complex wording that might confuse the user.
