# LearnPack VSCode Extension

We highly recommend you to use this one as it provides a better user experience for the Learners. 

This editor mode allows the users to see the instructions right inside the VSCode application, you don’t have to use many different tools but the ones you are used to, and you’ll have all the extensions and add-ons that you already have on your environment. 

Cool, right? To use it, you have to install our VSCode extension:

Then you just have to run `learnpack start` on the tutorial’s repository root and that will show the exercises for you!
