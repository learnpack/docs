## LearnPack Introduction

> ðŸ”¥ Creating interactive tutorials has never been so easy.

LearnPack is an interactive tutorial builder that allows content creators to build interactive and auto-graded tutorials with near-zero steps or friction.

## Reducing the friction when creating a tutorial:
You can easily create exercises with interactive instructions and automated tests by using LearnPack.
Learnpack scans your current folder looking for markdown files that will become tutorial instructions and unit-test files that will grade the student.

## Features:

- **Markdown support**: Add a bunch of README.md files and LearnPack will recognize them as tutorial or exercise steps. Discover our improved markdown features for personalized experiences.
- **Language Compilation**: Install any language plugin and make learnpack compile your student solutions in html/css, vanillajs, javascript, python, react.js, and other languages.
- **Automated tests**: Optionally add test.js files and LearnPack will recognize them as automated test for your exercises using jest. Python, PHP and other languages are also supported.
- **Very flexible configuration**: We want to allow the creators to configure what they want, creating more a personalized experience. Using the learn.json file, you can change the properties to personalize different features.
- **Zero steps for creators or students**: Learnpack scans your tutorial folder and starts running the tutorial immediatly, no additional steps for anyone.
- **Inside your own environment**: Run the tutorial directly in your own environment, take advantage of your user computer settings.
- **Interactive instructions**: You can easily create great interactive instructions with LearnPack as we use markdown for the instructions file.
