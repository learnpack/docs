# Rigobot: Your Learning Ally

Rigobot is the engine that powers various AI applications within 4Geeks.com, including the integrated AI mentor in LearnPack. Let's explore a bit more about how to use Rigobot in LearnPack and what it can do. Additionally, we'll discuss the benefits of having **continuous feedback** during the learning process.

## Benefits of Having an AI Mentor

Beyond the obvious help that artificial intelligence represents, let's explore the difference between an AI Mentor and a Programming Copilot. At the heart of Rigobot, it can be either, as it allows customizing the behavior of an AI using prompting techniques and optimal context management.

#### The LearnPack AI Tutor Won't Give You the Answer

The idea of having a mentor is to serve as a guide so that the student finds the answer on their own. The LearnPack mentor has knowledge of the code and the modifications you make, has memory of the last 4 interactions, and will respond in your preferred language. You can ask it to explain something in the way that is easiest for you.

This brings the benefit of constantly reviewing concepts and associating them with the code you are writing.

#### Continuous Feedback

The [learning process requires several factors](https://4geeks.com/mastering-technical-knowledge#feedback-quality-and-frequency), one of which is the quality and quantity of feedback you receive on what you are doing. With the **LearnPack AI mentor** giving you continuous feedback, the results of the tests, tutorials, or even solution files make it impossible for you not to progress on your own. Go at your own pace, repeat the steps if you wish by pressing the **Reset** button next to **Get Feedback**.
