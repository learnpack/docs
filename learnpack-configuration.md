# LearnPack Configuration

## The learn.json

The `learn.json` file is where all the configurations from the teacher should be set. These are the properties that you can change from the configuration:

<!-- Note: The properties marked with ? are optional, LearnPack is able to figure it out by itself based on the exercises of the tutorial.-->

*   `port`: The port where the instructions will be hosted. (Default: 3000).

*   `editor`: Editor will be the object with all the editor options, which are the following:
    
    *   `mode`: The mode could be `extension` (when using the vscode plugin) or `preview` (When working locally without vscode).
    
    *   `agent`: The agent is where you are going to show the instructions, it could be `vscode`, `os`.
    *   `version`: This is related to the UI version, by default, it will use the newest version of the UI, anyway you can use an older version.

* `video`: An object containing a property `intro`, that is an object that has as keys languages and as values an url for an intro video for the tutorial in each language you want. For example: 
```json
"video": {
    "intro": {

        "en": "www.example_video.url"
    }
}
```

> üò≥ Disclaimer: The next features are still a work in progress! Bear with us while we still develop them for you.

*   `bugs`: Add a link where the learners can report bugs found in your tutorial.

## Compiler Plugins

LearnPack has some plugins that allow you to compile and test tutorials in different languages. The languages covered by LearnPack so far are: python, javascript, html, css, dom, react.

These are the plugins for the named languages:

*   `@learnpack/html`
    

*   `@learnpack/node`
    

*   `@learnpack/python`
    

*   `@learnpack/dom`
    

*   `@learnpack/react`
    

PS: When using one of these languages with LearnPack, you have to install the corresponding plugin to compile and test the exercises. This is how you install the plugins:

```bash
$ learnpack plugins:install <name-of-plugin>
```

For example, let's install `@learnpack/html`:

```bash
learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/html
```

But currently LearnPack is able to install the plugin by itself based on the exercises you've added. üëÄ

### Flags

We are still working to add the new version with the flags. They will allow you to run the command with special behavior.

### Gitpod Integration

‚Äã[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an amazing tool that can help your tutorial‚Äôs user experience by allowing a very simple way to use Learnpack.

Using Gitpod on your tutorial will allow the learners to access and start the tutorials only by clicking once.

### Codespaces Integration

[Codespaces](https://github.visualstudio.com/features/codespaces/) provides a powerful, customizable, and scalable cloud development environment. LearnPack can run seamlessly within a Codespace, allowing learners to access and start tutorials with minimal setup. This integration ensures that all necessary dependencies and tools are pre-configured, making the learning process smooth and efficient.

By leveraging Codespaces, users can enjoy a fully featured development environment directly in their browser, which is especially beneficial for tutorials that require specific configurations or extensive toolchains. This integration simplifies the initial setup process, reduces potential errors, and allows learners to focus more on learning rather than configuring their development environment.

This is an example codespaces configuration:

.devcontainer/devcontainers.json
```json
{
	"name": "Node.js",
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18",
	"customizations": {
		"vscode": {
			"settings": {
				"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
				"workbench.editorAssociations": {   
					"*.md": "vscode.markdown.preview.editor"
				}
			},
			"extensions": ["learn-pack.learnpack-vscode"]
		}
	},

	"onCreateCommand": "npm i jest@24.8.0 -g && npm i @learnpack/learnpack@2.1.39 -g && learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/node@1.1.5 && learnpack plugins:install @learnpack/html@1.1.2"
}

```
